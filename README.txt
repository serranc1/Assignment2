How to set up Candy Crush:
1. Get the java files and put them into an empty Android Studio project.
2. Add the icons to the game by using the "New -> Image Asset" option on the drawable folder in project view. Name each icon with the name
   it comes with (Ex: If you're adding icon1.png as the image asset, name the image asset "icon1" and make sure it's a launcher icon).
3. Change the name of the package on each file to match your own package name.
4. Run the app to start the game.

How to Play Candy Crush:
-Get 3 or more candies in a row, column, or both to delete the candies and gain score.
-Swap the candies by pressing down on one candy, swiping to an adjacent candy, and letting go once you're ready to make the move.
-Candies won't swap if the move doesn't yield any score gain.
-The game ends when a certain score threshhold is reached (this can be modified) or when you run out of possible moves.

Disclaimers:
-Unlike the original Candy Crush game, this version doesn't implement special pieces (Ex: striped, bomb, rainbow, etc.).
-Animation isn't smooth since the screen is just refreshed with new icon placements after each move that is made.
